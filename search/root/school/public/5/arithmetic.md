# Arithmetic


## Unit 1
* Use equivalent fractions as a strategy to add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators  (2/5 + 7/3 = 6/15 + 35/15 = 41/15)
* Solve word problems with addition and subtraction of fractions or mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators
* Create models or equations to represent problems with fractions
* Understand a fraction as division of the numerator by the denominator
* Solve word problems dividing whole numbers leading to fraction or mixed number answers
* Multiply a fraction by a whole number or a whole number by a fraction
* Find areas of rectangles with fractional sides by modeling with unit squares
* Interpret multiplication as scaling (resizing)
* Explain results of multiplying a number by a fraction greater or less than 1
* Use all operations to solve world problems with fractions and mixed numbers

## Unit 2
* Compute and explain division of a fraction by a whole number
* Compute and explain division of a whole number by unit fraction
* Divide unit fractions by non-zero whole numbers and whole numbers by unit fractions
* Write and interpret numerical expressions
* Evaluate simple expressions
* Analyze patterns and relationships
* Expand a whole number (2-50) as a product of its prime factors
* Analyze patterns and relationships given two rules
* Understand the coordinate system and the meanings of the origin, x-axis, x-coordinate, y-axis, and y-coordinate
* Graph points in the first quadrant of the coordinate plane to solve real-world and mathematical problems

## Unit 3
* Classify two-dimensional figures into categories based on their properties
* Classify two-dimensional figures into a hierarchy
* Understand that each place in a number represents 10 times the place to right and one-tenth of the place to the left
* Know patterns of zeros when multiplying or dividing a number by powers of 10
* Use exponents to show powers of 10
* Read, write, and compare decimals to the thousandths place

* Use standard or improvised unit cubes to measure volume
* Find volume of rectangular prisms by packing the prism with unit cubes
* Know and apply formulas for the volume of right rectangular prisms
* Solve real world problems involving volume
* Find volumes of solid figures that are composed of two non-overlapping right rectangular prisms
